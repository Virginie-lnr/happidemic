    <h1 class="title">Our Mission</h1>
    <p class="mission">Every day we get so many news from all over the world: about countries, people, animals,
        plants, technology, environment etc. What most of them have in common? They are really
        bad news, annoying news, frustrating, negative. They make you feel angry, depressed and
        sad.</p>
