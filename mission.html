    <h1 class="title">Our Mission</h1>
    <p class="mission">Every day we get so many news from all over the world: about countries, people, animals,
plants, technology, environment etc. What most of them have in common? They are really
bad news, annoying news, frustrating, negative. They make you feel angry, depressed and
sad.
Especially in Covid-times everybody needs more positive news. News stories that make you
happy again. But it is really difficult to find this news, even on the Internet. Because most
magazines and newspapers concentrate on exciting events which are mostly depressing. This
is why we created this website: to spread positive news stories.
Looking for stories that are or were successful, reading them makes you feel confident. That
is what we need now.</p>
